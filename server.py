"""
This module starts a Flask web server for performing sentiment analysis
using a pre-trained NLP model through a sentiment analyzer API.

The application exposes two routes:
1. /sentimentAnalyzer : Accepts query text and returns sentiment label and score.
2. /                  : Renders the home page (index.html).

# Import Flask, render_template, request from the flask framework package
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
# Import the sentiment_analyzer function from the package created

        runs sentiment analysis over it using sentiment_analyzer()
